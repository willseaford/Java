I have a particular interest in the MVC design pattern in software design for its perceived cleanliness on pulling apart the seperate components which makes up a program and abstracting them to become their own subroutines. 

Apart from sometimes making it difficult towards human intuition and relatively easy to get confused with, The benefits of software design such as this outweighs the negative consequences.
